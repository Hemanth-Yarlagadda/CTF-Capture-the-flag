Gone throught the file and changed it to different extensions. In the end changed it to .doc extension.<br />
Now the word document, gone through the files in the word folder and extract them.<br />
Found a file named core.xml<br />
![base 64 flag](https://github.com/Hemanth-Yarlagadda/CTF-Capture-the-flag-/blob/master/Procedure/Flag%202/flag2.jpg)<br />
Decoded that base64 to ascii  and found the flag.<br />
**flag{Wh0se_th3_Auth0r_1_am_the__Author}<br />**
