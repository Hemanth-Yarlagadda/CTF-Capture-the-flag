Gone through the [file](https://github.com/Hemanth-Yarlagadda/CTF-Capture-the-flag-/blob/master/CTF%20files/f2.xxxx) and used the file command to know the type of the file.<br />

It turned out to be zip archive. Gone through the files in the word folder and extracted them.<br />

Found a file named core.xml<br />

![base 64 flag](https://github.com/Hemanth-Yarlagadda/CTF-Capture-the-flag-/blob/master/Procedure/Flag%202/flag2.jpg)<br />

Decoded that base64 to ascii  and found the flag.<br />

**flag{Wh0se_th3_Auth0r_1_am_the__Author}<br />**
