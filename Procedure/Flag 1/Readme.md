First flag was found in the [Flag 1](https://github.com/Hemanth-Yarlagadda/CTF-Capture-the-flag-/blob/master/CTF%20files/f1.xxxx)<br />
Changed the extension to .pdf<br />
Ran the file through pdf-parser and pdf info<br />
Found compressed data in the pdf file<br />
Made use of binwalk to extract the compressed data<br />
It is of javascript. I modified it, we get the flag<br />
