For this file too tried different extensions<br />
Added .apk extension to this file<br />
Made use of apktool which decoded the apk file<br />
Made use of the command grep -ri flag and found the flag in the values-af/strings.xml file.<br />
![flag]()
Converted from base64 to ascii we get the flag.<br />
**flag{@ndr01d_1s_0ur_fr31nd_r1ght}**
