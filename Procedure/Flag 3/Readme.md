For this [file](https://github.com/Hemanth-Yarlagadda/CTF-Capture-the-flag-/tree/master/Procedure/Flag%203) too tried different extensions<br />

Added .apk extension to this file<br />

Made use of apktool which decoded the apk file<br />

Made use of the command grep -ri flag and found the flag in the values-af/strings.xml file.<br />

![flag](https://github.com/Hemanth-Yarlagadda/CTF-Capture-the-flag-/blob/master/Procedure/Flag%203/flag3.jpg)
Converted from base64 to ascii we get the flag.<br />

**flag{@ndr01d_1s_0ur_fr31nd_r1ght}**
